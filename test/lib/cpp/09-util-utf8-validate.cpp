		to spot problems more quickly. (2) Overlong sequences provide
		alternative representations of characters, that could maliciously be
		used to bypass filters that check only for ASCII characters. For
		instance, a 2-byte encoded line feed (LF) would not be caught by a
		line counter that counts only 0x0a bytes, but it would still be
		processed as a line feed by an unsafe UTF-8 decoder later in the
		pipeline. From a security point of view, ASCII compatibility of UTF-8
		sequences means also, that ASCII characters are *only* allowed to be
		represented by ASCII bytes in the range 0x00-0x7f. To ensure this
		aspect of ASCII compatibility, use only "safe UTF-8 decoders" that
		reject overlong UTF-8 sequences for which a shorter encoding exists. */

		- In some UTF-16 receivers, code point U+FFFE might trigger a
		byte-swap operation (to convert between UTF-16LE and UTF-16BE).

		With such internal use of noncharacters, it may be desirable and safer
		to block those code points in UTF-8 decoders, as they should never
		occur legitimately in incoming UTF-8 data, and could trigger unsafe
		behaviour in subsequent processing.
